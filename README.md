Hi the name's Caco,

I'm a student in computer science and I post projects here.
Though super rarely, but I try.

Currently working on a discord bot for art stuff, future features *may* include :
Palette generator, for palette challenges for example
Prompt giver, for drawing exercices
Commands about color theory, to find colors or create palettes
Commands to enable/disable other commands or modify config, to make the bot more user-friendly
Monthly / weekly prompt giver, to rival *the october thing*

see you then, (I'll also probably make a blog here, ***ONE DAY***).

You may follow me on Twitter : @Cacofiin, or here
I'll answer questions about stuff I made
